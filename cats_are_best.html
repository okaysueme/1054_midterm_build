            <h2>Cats truly are the most intelligent animal</h2>
            <p>If anyone actually knows cats, they will know just how intelligent they really are. Cats have an innate sense for picking up on things, similar to what one would say is a sixth sense. Cats are so smart, and humans are really doing themselves a favour by taking care of such intelligent beings. Humans can really learn from cats and what they have to offer. If a human gives a cat a chance they will see just how smart they are and what they are capable of. If anything, a human should treat cats with the utmost respect, because they are capable of so much, being on a cats good side has such positive effects on your life! One thing you can count on is that they will keep your dwelling free of rodents, what a bonus!</p>

            <h2>A little more about why cats truly are the best animal...</h2>
            <p>If you have the pleasure of having a cat in your life, you understand why it is truly the best experience in terms of having a pet. You don't really own them, you are co-habitating with them and they are teaching you about life and what is important. Having a cat in your life is wonderful if you love to keep to yourself and have some alone time, as well as occasional time spent together. While it is important to give cats the attention they deserve, they are far less likely to be demanding your undivided attention 24/7, as they too love to go off on their own and explore as a solo mission. Cats are such a great way to build a bond with an animal while not feeling guilty if you have to spend a bit more time on your own demands in life. Cats will always be there for you at the end of the day, but will not be so distracting and attention-seeking as other animals - as long as their food bowl has been filled for the day! The bonus of knowing other people that love cats is that you can truly trust them as they have spent time loving and enjoying being around the best animal to grace this earth, and understand what it is like to be such a complex being!</p>

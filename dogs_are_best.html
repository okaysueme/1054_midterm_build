            <p>For as long as anyone can remember they've heard the familiar saying that "Dogs are a man's best friend." That's because it's always been true and will remain to be true until the end of time. Dogs are the most loyal creature on the face of the planet Earth, and will always be right by your side, tail wagging and eyes glimmering. They treat their humans like a King or Queen, which rules their world. If you're lacking attention and admiration in your life, a dog will be sure to fill that void and meet your needs and wants in a best friend, time and time again.</p>
